# Metroo Boomin Radio

This project is a simple web-based radio player featuring a playlist of songs. It allows users to play, pause, skip to the previous or next track, and displays the progress of the currently playing song. The playlist is initially shuffled to provide variety in song selection.

## Instructions
1. **Play/Pause Button:**
   - Click the play/pause button (center button with play or pause icon) to start or pause the currently playing song.

2. **Previous/Next Buttons:**
   - Use the previous and next buttons (left and right buttons with corresponding icons) to navigate between songs in the playlist.

3. **Song Progress:**
   - The progress bar at the bottom of the player indicates the progress of the currently playing song.

## Usage
- Simply open the HTML file in a web browser to start using the radio player.
- Click on the play/pause, previous, and next buttons to control playback.

## Supported Formats
- This player supports audio files in the MP3 format. Ensure that the audio files in the playlist are in the MP3 format for proper playback.

## Credits
- This project utilizes Ionicons for the player buttons.
- Special thanks to Metroo Boomin for inspiration.

## Note
